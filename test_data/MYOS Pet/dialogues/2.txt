Seller: Great question! A single 12.7oz canister comes with 120 scoops. For dogs 25-49lbs we recommend 2 scoops daily, totaling 60 days worth of Muscle Formula.
The Canine Muscle Formula is available in these sizes (shipping is $5):

A) 1 canister (12.7 oz) - $68 (normally $84.99)
B) 2 canister bundle (12.7 oz each) - $135.99 (normally $169.98)
C) 1 bag - $38.40 (6.35 oz) (normally $47.99)
D) Jumbo canister - $240 (50.8 oz) (normally $299.99)

Which size would you like?
Buyer: And about how long till you start seeing results? I have 4 dogs who I currently give platinum performace Supplements but wanted to try this out for at least one of my d
ogs and see how it works. They are competitive sport dogs.
