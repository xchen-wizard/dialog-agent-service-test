Moisturizing Hydra Cream Questions	-MHC is a much lighter weight, fast absorbing, very layerable moisturizer compared to SHW
-MHC is oil-free (unlike SHW)
-SHW is compatible with VCT (use VCT then SHW), we do not recommend using MHC w/ VCT bc VCT is oil based and MHC is water based
-SHW is a bit polarizing (some people LOVE it, others hate it -- it has coconut oil which can cause breakouts) so MHC was created to be a moisturizer that is friendly to a wider range of skin types (AKA all skin types) /less polarizing that SHW
-Still no back in stock date for SHW
