The following is the list of tasks and their descriptions.
- CreateOrUpdateOrderCart: When the buyer expresses their intention to start an order or purchase an item or add items to existing order. Sometimes they may ask to add or remove things from the cart.  Only when the buyer has confirmed that they are done adding things to their cart do we move on to the next task of FinalizeOrder.
