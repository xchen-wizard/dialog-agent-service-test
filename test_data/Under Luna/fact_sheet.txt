What shampoo or conditioner should I use?
Check out our hair quiz here: https://underluna.com/pages/hair-quiz

Are Under Luna products safe for color treated hair?
They are ALL safe for color treated hair. These products are as gentle as they get, yet effective. They are formulated to cleanse not strip so your color is safe!

What is the shelf life of the shampoo and conditioner?
These products are consistently being made and shipped to ensure that the shelf life is as long as possible once it reaches you. The shampoos and conditioners are best to be used within one year of purchase.

Are these products gluten free, cruelty free, vegan?
Under Luna products are gluten-free and absolutely cruelty-free! All products are vegan except the Revive and Serenity conditioners, which contain honey.

What can I expect from natural shampoo?
These products are not like commercial products. This is what makes them so great! They're safe, completely natural, smell delicious and your hair is finally going to thrive!

Will the shampoo lather?
The color, texture of the shampoo is different: it's a dark brown shampoo due to the root extract used. There is lather, but no crazy foam will be piling up on your head like a pantene commercial - those suds are all thanks to added chemicals.

How do I use the shampoo?
We strongly recommend double washing with these shampoos. When you first apply, you want to go directly to the scalp and massage. you won't notice a ton of foam and that's because the shampoo is doing its job. The soap is latching onto all the dirt molecules we are trying to rid our hair of. Scrub away, rinse, then follow up a smaller amount of shampoo. Apply to your scalp and massage again. This time you will notice more foam and bubbles. That is because the soap has much less to attach itself to which also means your hair is much cleaner than it was a minute ago.

How do I use the conditioner?
With the conditioner, do as you normally would. Gently squeeze the water from your hair and apply the conditioner to the bottom half of your hair. Let it sit as long as you can, then rinse.

How often should I wash my hair?
When transitioning to a natural shampoo your hair may go through a detox period. Your scalp will need to purge oils and build up from previous products and most likely you’ll want to wash more often. The number of days that means, is completely up to you and what you believe your hair needs. No one knows your body the way you know it. Putting expectations on yourself and only allowing you to wash your hair every 3 days or once a week and never wavering isn’t helpful. Sometimes this can cause scalp issues if we don’t care for our scalp the way it needs to be cared for. There is no wrong answer here and if it means a few times this week and only once next week, that’s perfect.

How do you open these pumps?
Place the pump inside the bottle and tighten. Hold your hand around the cap (holding it in place) and with the other hand, twist the pump in a counter clockwise direction. It will pop up from there.

Do you offer a refill service?
We do not offer a refill service at this time. After much research, we were not able to find a solution that was truly environmentally friendly and/or with a carbon footprint lower than shipping out another glass bottle. We will continue the search to find the right packaging and/or when Under Luna grows large enough, we’ll receive bottles back to sterilize and refill them ourselves. In the meantime, please be mindful of how you recycle this packaging: the glass and the recycled plastic bottles can all be recycled + reused!

Are these products safe during pregnancy?
There are only two herbs we suggest being aware of, possibly during the first trimester. There is sage essential oil in the Warrior shampoo and the white willow bark in Warrior shampoo and Revive conditioner that you can research. There are no hard facts against these two in such small quantities, but you can make the decision for yourself. The other products are all perfectly safe to use while pregnant.

I'd like to find a product that is great for my kids, but also for us adults?
The intention was to create products that are safe for kids, but also versatile so we can all use them - it’s all about simplicity! The Sweet Baby Orange shampoo or Unscented shampoo and Luna Love conditioner are all safe for kids. Sweet Baby Orange is gentle, non-toxic and safe for the littles, yet very effective for adults. The Luna Love conditioner is also made with gentle and safe oils for kids, and the aromatherapy qualities are great for adults! And finally, our Unscented shampoo is a wonderful option that is safe for kids or anyone with sensitivities. It has a number of scalp loving and hydrating herbs like nettle, plantain and loving calendula and chamomile.

What is best for postpartum hair, hair loss, shedding?
Supporting your health is key during this time. The shift in hormones will go at their own speed and time, so all you can do is support. Food, rest and nourishment through herbs, teas, and gentle and supportive hair care are all very helpful. Warrior shampoo has a number of strengthening herbs to help support, encourage growth and strengthen. Revive conditioner is a very nourishing conditioner and extra potent as a hair mask. We highly recommend doing a hair mask once a week, more if your hair is on the dry side. If you want to go a step further, the Ancient Remedy Hair + Scalp Oil is another potion that can be used as a scalp treatment. massage this into the roots at least 20 min prior to your shower, let it sit and then wash your hair as usual. All of these products are gentle, loving and very supportive for this major shift your body is going through.

Can you ship to PO Boxes?
We do not ship to PO Boxes. We use Fedex and USPS to ship out our orders, so the address provided needs to be able to accept mail from both.
